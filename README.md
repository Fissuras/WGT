WGT - WordUp Graphics Toolkit by Egerter Software

A long time ago, in a galaxy not really far away, a developer decided to release the source code of all his graphics libraries.
He then announced it to the world, with these very words: http://www.verycomputer.com/279_96e227221363fac0_1.htm
He also posted a note on his company's site that can be viewed here: http://web.archive.org/web/20000606010204/http://www.egerter.com/index3.htm
September 14th, 1999.
That was the release day.
Files were available and ready to download, as can be seen in this archived page, if you don't believe my words: http://web.archive.org/web/20001027023929/http://www.egerter.com/opensource.htm
But all things shall pass... as the company passed and the source code vanished away from the net, not to be heard, seen or compiled again, as not even the mighty archiver got a hold on those files.
And the files were lost, as not even the author had a backup, or so it seems. Nor even Google was able to find any clue of those sources wherabouts.
Until the day came and I found those files in an old, unused hard drive.

To make it short, I am uploading those sources here to preserve them so that they do not get lost forever, under GPL as decided by Chris Egerter himself:
